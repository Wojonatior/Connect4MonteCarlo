Assumptions:
Board is 7x6
I will never be provided an invalid game state
  Eg. Floating Pieces
  Pieces in an unpossible order
  1st player being more than one piece ahead of the second player
  Both players winning

Generate a lot of the earlier moves, and use heruistics to pick the categorically best one.

Use monteCarlo to analyze possible solutions
Pre-generate best moves and look them up in a hash
  convert game state into a hash
    2 bits per coordinate
    42 coordinates
    84 bits
    /4 for each hexidecimal "digit"
    21 hex digits can represent the game state

Checking for a win
  Count in 4 directions
  N-S
  E-W
  NE-SW
  SE-NW
